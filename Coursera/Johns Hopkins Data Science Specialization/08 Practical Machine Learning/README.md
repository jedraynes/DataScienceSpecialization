# Practical Machine Learning

Practical Machine Learning is the eighth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization offered by Coursera. The course page can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning?specialization=data-science-statistics-machine-learning). There was one project in this course, which can be found in the Week 4 folder.

**Project 1**: In this project, I explored the Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset. Information regarding the data can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). After cleaning the data, I used a simple decision tree/CART model and a random forest model to classify an activity based on numerical values. I then applied my final model to the 20 test cases to receive a set of predictions.
