# Developing Data Products

Practical Machine Learning is the ninth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization offered by Coursera. The course page can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products). There were three projects in this course assigned during weeks 2, 3, and 4. You can find the project files within the respective project folders. Because I view things on a weekly basis, all projects are labeled project 1 within each folder. However, for purposes of this README file, I've labeled them projects 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Details regarding data sources and analyses performed can be found within the respective project directories and files.

**Project 1**: Leaflet

In this project, I collected the latitude and longitude for the national parks in the United States. I then used Leaflet to plot each park.

**Project 2**: Presentation and Plotly

For my Plotly plot, I (somewhat) recreated a plot I originally created in Python. I used non-farm minimum wage data scraped from the United States Department of Labor and visualized the actual minimum wage versus the inflation adjusted wage from 1968 to 2019. My findings are summarized in a presentation which I published on RPubs for project submission. The markdown file in a document format can be found on my personal site linked below.

**Project 3**: R Shiny and Reproducible Pitch

Using R Shiny, I created a simple application that is hosted by ShinyApps.io. The application allows users to select one or multiple tickers between Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the S&P 500 index (using the ETF SPY as a proxy). Additionally, users can select their own date range with the oldest date being 5 years ago as of April 2, 2021. Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance. Findings are summarized in the application hosted by ShinyApps.io and in a presentation published on RPubs. The markdown file in a document format can be found on my personal site linked below.
