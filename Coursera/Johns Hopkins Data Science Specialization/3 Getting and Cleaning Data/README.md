# Getting and Cleaning Data

This respository is all files related to the Getting and Cleaning Data course within Coursera's Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization. The files and quiz code for each week can be found within its respective folder. The course project is found within week 4 and the description of the project is outlined below.

**Project 1**

The purpose of this project is to gather files and create two, tidy datasets. The first dataset is a merge of the training and testing data as provided in the course materials. In addition to merging, feature labels and a lookup to the activity labels (via a left join) were also added to get the final clean dataset for task 1: df_clean. The second dataset is the mean of each column, excluding the categorical activity label which can be found in the output: df_mean.

The instructions are as follows:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The dataset required for this project can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and is originally sourced from [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). For a description of the variables, see the original source link and the features_info.txt file within the UCI HAR Dataset folder in the repository.
