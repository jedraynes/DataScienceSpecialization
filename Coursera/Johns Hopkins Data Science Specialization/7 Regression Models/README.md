# Regression Models

This is the seventh course in the Coursera Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization. The course site can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models). The project analysis can be found within the Week 4 folder.

**Project 1**: For this project, I explored the relationship between various independent variables and the dependent variable (MPG) using the [mtcars dataset](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars). Using Rmd (via knitr), I created a report to explore the data and answer the following questions:

- Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
- Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?
