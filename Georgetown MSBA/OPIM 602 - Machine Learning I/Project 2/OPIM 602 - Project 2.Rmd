# background

# A large company named Canterra, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons:
# 
# The former employeesâ€™ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners
# A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent
# More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatize themselves to the company
# The management hypothesizes that higher job satisfaction and a higher number of total working years will reduce employee attrition. Additionally, the marketing management was interested to know if demographic variables such as gender, education and age affect employee attrition. Hence, the management has contracted you as a consultant to understand whether these two factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know if changes in their internal and external recruitment strategies would help retain employees.
```

```{r}
# key questions

# Identify whether job satisfaction, years at the company, and a higher number of total working years lead to employee attrition within the company? (20 points) Additionally, do demographic variables such as gender, education, and age affect employee attrition. (20 points) Use a multiple Logistic Regression model using all the above variables to determine the model fit at 95% significance. 
# Which of the above variables significantly impact employee attrition? (20 points)
# Provide your insights using model accuracy measures, a ROC curve, and other measures using a probability cut off of 50%. (20 points)
# Provide your recommendations to the management based on insights generated from the above model. (10 points)
